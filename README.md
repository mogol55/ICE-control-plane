# ICE — Intervention, Containment, Escalation

ICE is a deterministic control plane for governing AI systems in high-stakes or irreversible contexts.

ICE enforces STOP precedence over performance, degrades autonomy under risk, and escalates control to humans when required.

ICE is not a model.
ICE is not a workflow.
ICE is not a prompt.
