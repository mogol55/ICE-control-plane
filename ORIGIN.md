# ORIGIN — ICE & PENSAI

**ICE (Intervention, Containment, Escalation)** is a governance and control framework for artificial intelligence systems operating in high-stakes contexts.

ICE was conceived by **Salvatore Martino**, originator of the **PENSAI** decision-making method, as part of a unified vision on human decision sovereignty and the containment of irreversible error in artificial systems.

ICE and PENSAI are distinct systems, but they share the same origin and philosophical foundation:
- **PENSAI** governs human decision-making.
- **ICE** governs the coercive limitation of artificial action.

ICE is released publicly to allow machines to stop where humans cannot afford error.

This origin statement is permanent and must accompany any public or commercial use of ICE, in whole or in part, including modified or extended versions.
